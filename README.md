# Apps-Case-Study
It is about a case study of difference of rating on Apps at Google Play and App Store. The data was already provided. 
Data wrangling was done to clean the data and removing missing values. Hypothesis test was done to figure out if the
average rating is the same on both platforms. Parameters from permutation data were compared with parameters from 
observed data and null hypothesis of identical average rating at both platforms was rejected.
